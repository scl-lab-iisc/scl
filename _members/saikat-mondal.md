Hello! I am Saikat Mondal, M.Tech(Coursework 2022-24) student in the Department of Computational and Data Sciences, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, India. Prior to this, I did MSc in Mathematics from RKMVERI, Belur Math, WB. I did M-Tech internship with AMD India, as a ML Co-Op.

My primary research topics is stochastic processes on IR drop estimation using reaction diffusion modelling. With a background in maths, ml and graph theory, 
I have developed a algorithm based on stochastic properties of heat equation.

Currently, I am working with BEL India as a member of research staff, where we are working on mathematical crypto algorithms for secure Indian defence communication.
