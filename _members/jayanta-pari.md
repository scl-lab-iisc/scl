Hello! I am Jayanta Pari, a PhD student in the Department of Computational and Data Sciences, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, India. Prior to this, I was working as an algorithm designer at ITI Limited, Bengaluru, India.

My primary research interests lie in exploring stochastic dynamics of complex network of simplices. In broad sence, building simplicial complex network from real world dataset and finding the stochastic behavior of different attributes. The objective of undertaking this work is to understand the underlying principles governing these systems and to develop tools and methodologies for addressing real-world challenges.

Currently, I am working on the development of a stocastic flow model through this type of network and trying to find the relation between the stiffness of a system and filtered simplicial complex.
