# Scientific Computation Lab
We, at our lab, dedicate our research to investigate the computational analysis of Stochastic Differential-Algebraic Equations (SDAEs) and stiff Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). We explore various aspects such as partitioning techniques, stability analysis, and stochastic characterization within Dynamic Complex Networks. This entails delving into the dynamics and behavior of complex systems under uncertainty, utilizing computational tools to understand the stochastic processes governing their evolution.

Our lab has open research positions including Ph.D. and M.Tech. (Research). We welcome applications from highly motivated individuals with a passion for research. Interested candidates can apply through IISc admissions conducted twice a year. We look forward to receiving your application!
