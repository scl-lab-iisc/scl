Hello! I'm Mustafa Namliwala, a final year M.Tech Student from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, in the Department of Computational and Data Sciences. I completed my Bachelor’s in Electronics and my Master’s thesis on developing a gaze-based distraction model to enhance driver safety. This project employed computer vision and deep learning to make the system efficient on smaller devices.

Professionally, I've worked with ExxonMobil and Lightmetrics, focusing on machine learning and deep learning. I am excited to start my next chapter as a Senior Data Scientist at Lam Research, where I plan to continue improving computational models for practical applications.
