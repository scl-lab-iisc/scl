Hello! I am Major Jitin Batra, a final year M.Tech. (coursework) student in the Department of Computational and Data Sciences, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, India. Prior to this, I was working as a Logistics Officer at ASC Center and College, Bengaluru, India.

My primary research interests lie in Scientific computation and studying properties of graphs to harness their power to unlock valuable insights and solve complex problems. With a background in data analysis, network theory and data visualization, I thrive on transforming raw data into actionable intelligence.

Currently, I am working on the development of a stable graph partitioning strategy in order to maintain stability and connectivity within the military networks.
