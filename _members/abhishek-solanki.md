Hello! I am Abhishek Solanki, a final year M.Tech. (coursework) student in the Department of Computational and Data Sciences, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, India. I have recently completed a project on "Tracking of Unknown Satellite, Its Identification, and Orbit Determination" in collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). 

My primary research interests lie in space exploration, satellite tracking, and computational methods for orbit determination. With a background in data analysis, I am passionate about leveraging technology to enhance our understanding of satellite dynamics and improve tracking accuracy.

In my recent project with DRDO, I focused on developing algorithms to identify unknown satellites and accurately determine their orbits. This work has practical applications in enhancing space situational awareness and ensuring the safety of space operations.
